# Bash Shell Script Terminal Emulator

## Overview

This project is a simple Bash shell script that emulates basic terminal functionality. The goal is to provide a basic understanding of how terminal commands can be implemented and executed within a script, mimicking a basic shell environment.

## Features

- Supports the following commands:
  - `ls` – List directory contents
  - `cd` – Change the current directory
  - `pwd` – Print the current working directory
  - `echo` – Print text to the terminal
  - `exit` – Exit the emulator
- Error handling for unsupported commands.
- User-friendly output and feedback for basic operations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
Make the script executable:

Run the script:
